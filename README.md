# Penguin Power Allocation

Places power stations on a grid so that the penguins all have power, and waste-energy is minimized.

Usage: `python3 run.py`

Note: This requires that the output directory exists in the current working directory, with small, medium, and large subdirectories that also exist. This command will potentially overwrite any content already in these folders.
